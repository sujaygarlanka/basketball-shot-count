# IGNORE_THRESH is the threshold whether to consider a certain detection is considered as non-object.
# As described in YOLOv3, "If the bounding box prior is not the best but does overlap a ground truth object
# by more than some threshold, we ignore the prediction." What the author really means is that:
# If the max IOU between the raw detection and all the ground truths is larger than IGNORE_THRESH, but not the best
# IOU among all the candidate detections with this ground truth, then we consider this detection will not contribute
# to the loss function.
